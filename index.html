	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>Iâ€™m a Graphic Designer/Digital Marketer, living in Woburn, MA. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I was having trouble finding a job in my field upon graduation last May.</p>

	<h2>Other</h2>
	<p>In my spare time you might find me with a camera in hand, aiming to snap a candid photo of the people or places around me. I also have an entire file cabinet full of folders documenting my past and future travels. I love immersing myself in the unknown, especially when it comes to different cultures, and documenting my experiences. So far I have visited 34 out of the 50 states of the US, Mexico, Canada, and Japan. My future travel plans will take me down Route 66 as well as through out Europe and Australia.</p>
