	<h1>My Site Goals: Unit 2 Challenge</h1>

	<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
	<p>I was most inspired by the home page for <a href="http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2014/matisse/" target="_blank">MOMA</a> depicting their exhibition for Henri Mattisse and by the home page for <a href="http://www.tankdesign.com/" target="_blank">Tank Design Agency</a> in Boston, MA.</h2>

	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
	<p>The MOMA web page used a very interesting focal point depicting the name of the exhibition to draw viewers into the page. The interesting use of space used in the breaking up of Henri Matisse set the viewers up for what was to come in the exhibition. I also thought it was interesting to put the nav bar for this site at the bottom of the page. However, by doing this the creator has beautifully balanced the heavy and stiking blue color against the bright white negative space on the page. If that blue bar had been placed at the top of the page, the top of the page would have been very heavy to view and the focal point probably would not stand out as much.</p>
	<p>The Tank Design webpage really drew me in with the large fade-in gallery used at the top of the page to give viewers a peek at some of their work. The gallery creates an interesting focal point that changes and keeps the viewers involved with the page. I also enjoyed the clean grid use that this web page displays. The gallery spans the width of the grid and then the portfolio work beneath the gallery uses the grid system to beautifully and cleanly guide viers through the portfolio of the agency. The light gray negative space creates a nice spacial balance against the dark, bold images of the projects. Finally, the spaing in the nav bar works to keep the grid and balance the offset agency name in the top right hand corner of the page.</p>

	<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
	<p>The similarities that drew me to compare these two sites included their clean use of space, their dramatic focal points (neither of which included the title of the page) and the well contrasted positive and negative space on the page. The differences that drew me to compare these two sites mainly come from the grid used on each page. Tank Design has a very clear and clean grid use to their page where MOMA's page is not as clear. The focal point is in the middle and the rest of the page spans the width of the window. Both uses of the grid are effective for the message of the page.</p>

	<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Homepage and About Pages</strong> <br>
			<img src="HomepageAbout.jpg" alt="Homepage/About Thumbnails" height="400" width="700"> <br>
			<p>This sketch page shows two different options each for the homepage and the about page for a website I would like to build. Under the Homepage bullet, the first option depicts a minimilistic page where the logo and title of the page would act as the large, bold focal point on the page. A simple nav bar would balance this focal point by consisting of smaller text in the upper right hand of the page. From here, viewers could understand the page they have arrived at and be able to easily locate any other piece of the site they want to view. The second sketch for homepage consists of a broader focal point by using a gallery of sorts to preview the work showcased within the site. By clicking on the logo above the gallery, users would be able to enter the site and find their way through the other pages. The boldness of the project images would balance the larger but not as bold logo image above it.</p>
			<p>Under the About bullet, the first option depicts a small logo image on the top left balanced out by a text nav bar in the top right. The logo image is also balanced by the larger image included on the page under the nav bar. The bio text would be included to the left of the image, under the logo, with a buffer of negative space to frame it and keep everything in line. The second image depicts a similar layout. However, here, the nav bar has been moved under the logo to allow a balanced collage of images in place of the single image seen in the first sketch.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Portfolio and Contact Pages</strong> <br>
			<img src="PortfolioContact.jpg" alt="Portfolio/Contact Thumbnails" height="400" width="700">
			<p>As with the above set of images, this sketch page shows two different options, this time each for the portfolio and the contact page for the website. Under the Portfolio bullet, the first option depicts a bold nav bar to balance out the simplicity of a portfolio page. Using the grid system, the project pieces would be layed out in a collage style with ample amounts of negative space around the images. The second option depicts a simpler nav bar and a more skewed layout that would allow for the inclusion of a small block of text next to each image to describe the project to the viewer</p>
			<p>Under the Contact bullet, the first option depicts a bold nav bar to balance out he lack of imagery on this page. the bold header would consist of the title of the page followed by a balanced use of the grid to lay out the message form and the information. The second option for this page is much more minimalistic, but includes the use of images to depict the 3 different methods of contacting me.</p>
